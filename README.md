## Notes and Improvements
### Performance
For scalability, consider using caching mechanisms (such as Redis) for leaderboard data. This ensures fast retrieval of top users and can handle large numbers of requests.
Security:
### Security
Implement JWT expiration to enhance security.
Consider using OAuth for authentication if your application is integrated with third-party platforms.
Data Integrity:
### Data Integrity
Introduce transaction management to ensure that score updates are atomic and not inconsistent in case of errors or crashes.
Error Handling:
### Error Handling
Ensure proper error handling throughout the system, including logging and monitoring for failures in score updates.
